//Task List:
//1. Adds the following state values into the initialState:
//  - an array of smurfs
//  - a boolean indicating if the app is loading
//  - a string indicating a possible error message

//2. Add in the arguments needed to complete a standard reducer function.
//3. Add in a reducer case to accomidate the start of a smurf fetch.
//4. Add in a reducer case to accomidate the successful smurf api fetch.
//5. Add in a reducer cases to accomidate the failed smurf api fetch.
//6. Add in a reducer case to accomidate adding a smurf (including the name, nickname, position, summary and an internally generated id) into your smurf list.
//7. Add in a reducer case that adds in a value to the error message.
